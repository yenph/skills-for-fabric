  Develop Microsoft Fabric Spark/data engineering workflows and write code in Fabric Notebook cells
  with intelligent routing to specialized resources. Provides workspace/lakehouse management, notebook
  code authoring (PySpark, Scala, SparkR, SQL), and routes to: data engineering patterns, development
  workflow, or infrastructure orchestration. Use when the user wants to: (1) manage Fabric workspaces
  and resources, (2) write or debug code in notebook cells, (3) use notebookutils, (4) develop
  notebooks and PySpark applications, (5) design data pipelines, (6) provision infrastructure as code.
  Triggers: "develop notebook", "data engineering", "workspace setup", "pipeline design",
  "infrastructure provisioning", "Delta Lake patterns", "Spark development", "lakehouse configuration",
  "write notebook code", "notebookutils", "notebook cell", "PySpark notebook",
  "%%sql", "%%configure", "fabric notebook", "run notebook", "notebook deployment".

> **Update Check — ONCE PER SESSION (mandatory)**
> The first time this skill is used in a session, run the **check-updates** skill before proceeding.
> - **GitHub Copilot CLI / VS Code**: invoke the `check-updates` skill.
> - **Claude Code / Cowork / Cursor / Windsurf / Codex**: compare local vs remote package.json version.
> - Skip if the check was already performed earlier in this session.

> **CRITICAL NOTES**
> 1. To find the workspace details (including its ID) from workspace name: list all workspaces and, then, use JMESPath filtering
> 2. To find the item details (including its ID) from workspace ID, item type, and item name: list all items of that type in that workspace and, then, use JMESPath filtering

# Spark Authoring — CLI Skill

This skill covers two complementary areas: (1) **managing Fabric Spark artifacts via REST APIs** (workspaces, lakehouses, notebooks, jobs, pipelines) and (2) **writing code inside Fabric Notebook cells** (PySpark, Scala, SparkR, SQL with correct lakehouse access, notebookutils, and Spark configuration). For notebook code authoring fundamentals and shared modules, see [SPARK-NOTEBOOK-AUTHORING-CORE.md](../../common/SPARK-NOTEBOOK-AUTHORING-CORE.md).

## Must/Prefer/Avoid

### MUST DO
- **Check for recent jobs BEFORE creating new notebook runs** — Query job instances from last 5 minutes; if recent job exists, monitor it instead of creating duplicate
- **Capture job instance ID immediately after POST** — Store job ID before any other operations to enable proper monitoring
- **Verify workspace capacity assignment** before operations — Workspace must have capacity assigned and active
- **When user provides a public data URL, follow the Public URL Data Ingestion policy** — keep detailed behavior in the linked resource section to avoid drift/duplication
- **Format notebook cells correctly** — Each line in cell source array MUST end with `\n` to prevent code merging
- **Use correct Lakehouse Livy session body format** — Send a FLAT JSON with `name`, `driverMemory`, `driverCores`, `executorMemory`, `executorCores`. Do NOT wrap in `{"payload": ...}` or send only `{"kind": "pyspark"}` — that causes HTTP 500. Use valid memory values (28g, 56g, 112g, 224g). See Create Lakehouse Livy Session example below and SPARK-CONSUMPTION-CORE.md.

### PREFER
- **Poll job status with proper intervals** — 10-30 seconds between polls; timeout after reasonable duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
- **Check job history when POST response is unreadable** — If POST returns "No Content" or unreadable response, query recent jobs (last 1 minute) before retrying
- **Use Starter Pool for development** — Development/testing workloads should use `useStarterPool: true`
- **Use Workspace Pool for production** — Production workloads need consistent performance with `useWorkspacePool: true`
- **Enable lakehouse schemas** during creation — Set `creationPayload.enableSchemas: true` for better table organization
- **Implement idempotency checks** — Prevent duplicate operations by checking existing state first

### AVOID
- **Never retry POST with same parameters** — If you have a job ID, only use GET to check status; don't create duplicate job instances
- **Don't skip capacity verification** — Operations will fail if workspace capacity is paused or unassigned
- **Avoid immediate POST retries on failures** — Check for existing/active jobs first to prevent duplicates
- **Don't create new runs if monitoring existing job** — One job at a time; wait for completion before submitting new runs
- **Don't hardcode workspace/lakehouse IDs** — Discover dynamically via item listing or catalog search APIs
- **Do NOT use Lakehouse Livy sessions to run a Fabric notebook** — Lakehouse Livy sessions (the public Livy API) are for ad-hoc interactive Spark code execution. To run a notebook as a job, use the Jobs API (`RunNotebook`) which creates a Notebook Spark session internally. See SPARK-AUTHORING-CORE.md § Notebook Execution & Job Management

---


## RULES — Read these first, follow them always

> **Rule 1 — Validate prerequisites before operations.**
> Verify workspace has capacity assigned (see COMMON-CORE.md Create Workspace and Capacity Management) and resource IDs exist before attempting operations.
>
> **Rule 2 — Trust updateDefinition success.**
> A `Succeeded` poll result from `updateDefinition` is sufficient confirmation that content and lakehouse bindings persisted. Do NOT call `getDefinition` after every upload — it is an async LRO that adds significant latency. Only use `getDefinition` for its intended purpose: reading current notebook content before making modifications.
>
> **Rule 3 — Prevent duplicate jobs and monitor execution properly.**
> Before submitting new notebook run, ALWAYS check for recent job instances first (last 5 minutes). If recent job exists, monitor it instead of creating duplicate. After submission, capture job instance ID immediately and poll status - never retry POST. See SPARK-AUTHORING-CORE.md Job Monitoring for patterns.
>
> **Rule 4 — For notebook code authoring, follow SPARK-NOTEBOOK-AUTHORING-CORE.md.**
> When writing code inside notebook cells, always read [SPARK-NOTEBOOK-AUTHORING-CORE.md](../../common/SPARK-NOTEBOOK-AUTHORING-CORE.md) first — it defines the code generation approach, rules, and a Module Index linking to detailed guides (lakehouse paths, connections, context, orchestration, etc.). Use the Spark-specific resources in this skill ([data-engineering-patterns.md](resources/data-engineering-patterns.md), [development-workflow.md](resources/development-workflow.md)) for Spark-only implementation details.

## Quick Start Examples

For detailed patterns, authentication, and comprehensive API usage, see:
- **COMMON-CORE.md** — Fabric REST API patterns, authentication, item discovery
- **COMMON-CLI.md** — `az rest` usage, environment detection, token acquisition
- **SPARK-AUTHORING-CORE.md** — Notebook deployment, lakehouse creation, job execution

Below are minimal quick-start examples. **Always reference the COMMON-* files for production use.**

### Create Workspace & Lakehouse
```bash
# See COMMON-CORE.md Environment URLs and SPARK-AUTHORING-CORE.md for full patterns
cat > /tmp/body.json << 'EOF'
{"displayName": "DataEng-Dev"}
EOF
workspace_id=$(az rest --method post --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces" \
  --body @/tmp/body.json --query "id" --output tsv)

cat > /tmp/body.json << 'EOF'
{"displayName": "DevLakehouse", "type": "Lakehouse", "creationPayload": {"enableSchemas": true}}
EOF
lakehouse_id=$(az rest --method post --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/$workspace_id/items" \
  --body @/tmp/body.json --query "id" --output tsv)
```

### Organize Lakehouse Tables with Schemas
```python
# See SPARK-AUTHORING-CORE.md Lakehouse Schema Organization for table organization patterns
# Create schemas for medallion architecture
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS bronze")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS silver")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS gold")
```

### Create Lakehouse Livy Session
```bash
# See SPARK-CONSUMPTION-CORE.md for Lakehouse Livy session configuration and management
# IMPORTANT: Body MUST be flat JSON with memory/cores — do NOT wrap in {"payload": ...}
cat > /tmp/body.json << 'EOF'
{"name": "dev-session", "driverMemory": "56g", "driverCores": 8, "executorMemory": "56g", "executorCores": 8, "conf": {"spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled": "true", "spark.fabric.pool.name": "Starter Pool"}}
EOF
az rest --method post --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" \
  --url "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/$workspace_id/lakehouses/$lakehouse_id/livyapi/versions/2023-12-01/sessions" \
  --body @/tmp/body.json
```

> **Lakehouse Livy Session Body — Common Mistakes**
> - ❌ `{"payload": {"kind": "pyspark"}}` → HTTP 500 (wrong wrapper, missing required fields)
> - ❌ `{"kind": "pyspark"}` → HTTP 500 (missing `driverMemory`, `executorMemory`, etc.)
> - ✅ Flat JSON with `name`, `driverMemory`, `driverCores`, `executorMemory`, `executorCores` (and optionally `conf` with Starter Pool)

### Spark Performance Configs
**For detailed workload-specific configurations, see data-engineering-patterns.md Delta Lake Best Practices.**

Quick reference:
```python
# Write-heavy (Bronze): Disable V-Order, enable autoCompact
# Balanced (Silver): Enable V-Order, adaptive execution  
# Read-heavy (Gold): Vectorized reads, optimal parallelism
# See data-engineering-patterns.md for complete config tables
```
